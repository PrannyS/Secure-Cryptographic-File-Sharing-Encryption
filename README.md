## üìå Overview 
This repository contains two cryptographic implementations designed to provide secure file sharing and encryption, ensuring **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Authentication**. The projects focus on using a combination of **symmetric encryption, asymmetric encryption, and hashing algorithms** to protect sensitive files.

### Projects Covered

1. Secure Group File Sharing (Bash + OpenSSL)
- Uses ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography) and ECDH (Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman) for key exchange.
- Encrypts files using AES-256-GCM and signs them with ECDSA.
- Generates individual cryptographic envelopes for each recipient.
- Verifies file integrity through digital signatures.

2. Secure Encryption & Signing (Python + Cryptography Library)
- Implements hybrid encryption using AES-256-GCM for encryption and RSA/ECC for key exchange.
- Supports both PEM and DER key formats.
- Verifies file integrity and authenticity using digital signatures.
- Efficient for large binary files.

## Methodology

### 0Ô∏è‚É£ Environment Setup

- For lab 1
```bash
sudo apt install openssl
chmod +x crypto.sh
```

- For lab 2
```bash
pip install cryptography
```

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Secure Group File Sharing (Bash + OpenSSL)
#### Encryption & Signing (Sender)
```bash
./crypto.sh -sender <receiver1_pub> <receiver2_pub> <receiver3_pub> <sender_priv> <plaintext_file> <zip_filename>
```
- Generates a unique encryption key using ECDH + KDF.
- Encrypts the file using AES-256-GCM.
- Signs the encrypted file using ECDSA.
- Packages the encrypted file and signature into a ZIP archive.

#### Decryption & Verification (Receiver)
```bash
./crypto.sh -receiver <receiver_priv> <sender_pub> <zip_file> <plaintext_file>
```
- Extracts the encrypted file and signature.
- Verifies the ECDSA signature to ensure authenticity.
- Decrypts the file only if the recipient's private key matches the envelope.


### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Secure Encryption & Signing (Python + Cryptography Library)
#### Encryption & Signing (Sender)
```bash
python fcrypt.py -e destination_public_key.pem sender_private_key.pem input.txt encrypted_file.enc
```
- Generates a symmetric encryption key.
- Encrypts the file using AES-256-GCM.
- Signs the file with ECDSA or RSA

#### Decryption & Verification (Receiver)
```bash
python fcrypt.py -d destination_private_key.pem sender_public_key.pem encrypted_file.enc decrypted_output.txt
```
- Verifies the digital signature.
- Decrypts the file if verification is successful.
